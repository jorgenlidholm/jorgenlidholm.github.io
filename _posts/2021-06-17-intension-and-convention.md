In a few blog posts I will discoss some points that I believe help improve
the maintainability of software. I intent to mainly (if not only) present 
examples in C#, however most ideas should be language agnostic.


{% highlight csharp linenos %}
class Program
{
    public static void Main(string [] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
